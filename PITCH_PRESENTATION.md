### **10-Minute Pitch Presentation**

---

## 📍 **THE CRISIS WE FACE** *(2 minutes)*

### **Every 2 seconds, someone needs blood. Every 3 seconds, someone dies waiting for it.**

**🚨 The Numbers Don't Lie:**
- **6.8 million** people donate blood annually
- **13.6 million** units needed per year  
- **1 in 7** patients entering hospitals need blood
- **38,000** blood donations needed **DAILY**
- **Only 37%** of population eligible to donate, **less than 10% actually donate**

**💔 The Real Problem:**
```
❌ Manual, paper-based systems causing 3-hour delays
❌ No real-time inventory tracking → 25% shortage rates
❌ Zero transparency → Donors lose trust
❌ Emergency requests take 45+ minutes to process
❌ No automated alerts → Critical shortages go unnoticed
❌ Hospital coordination failures → Lives lost in transit
```

**🎯 Result: 4,500 people die DAILY due to blood shortage delays**
