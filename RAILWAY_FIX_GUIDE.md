## 🔍 **IF STILL GETTING 500 ERROR:**

### **View Detailed Error (Temporarily Enabled):**

Since I enabled DEBUG=True, you should now see detailed error information instead of just "500 Server Error". This will help us identify the specific issue.

### **Common Issues & Quick Fixes:**

1. **Database Connection Issue:**
   - Railway should auto-provide PostgreSQL
   - Check Railway dashboard for database status

2. **Missing Dependencies:**
   - All requirements are in requirements.txt
   - Railway should auto-install them

3. **Migration Issues:**
   - Fixed in nixpacks.toml to run migrations automatically

4. **Static Files:**
   - Added collectstatic command to build process
